The RTI abstraction component for MS.NET (RACoN) deals with the HLA runtime infrastructure (RTI) level communication 
in order to access the federation-wide data (actually, the objects and interactions exchanged in federation). 
RTI is middleware broker software that manages the federation execution and object exchange through a federation execution.
The RACoN provides the .NET wrapper classes for the RTI and RTI-specific data structures. 
As it offers more maintainable, robust, and portable methods, developing an abstraction layer (wrapper) over RTI 
is a popular approach in many HLA-based projects.

Please note that this is a research and an academic library that is not intended for a production environment. 
No support is guaranteed. Use it at your own risk. Also note that the versions do not follow backward compatibility policy. 
This means that a new version may not work with an older version of the library, which may cause loss of work.
