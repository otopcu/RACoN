  /// The RTI abstraction component for .NET (RACoN).

  /// <remarks>RACoN deals with the HLA runtime infrastructure (RTI) level communication in order to access the federation-wide data (actually, the objects and interactions exchanged in federation). RTI is a middleware broker software that manages the federation execution and management, and object exchanges through a federation execution.
  /// The RACoN provides the .NET wrapper classes for the RTI and RTI-specific data structures. As it offers more maintainable, robust, and portable methods, developing an abstraction layer (wrapper) over RTI is a popular approach in many HLA-based projects.
